#asg05

**Description:**
For this project, I wrote the code in **[Proj05Runner.java](Proj05Runner.java)** to produce a GUI constructed of Swing components that met the requirements posted below.

**Requirements:**
- Your GUI must be constructed of Swing components.
- A single JFrame object will appear on the screen and a single JButton will appear at the top of the frame with the caption Quit.
- Your name must appear in the banner at the top of the JFrame object.
- When the user clicks the button with the X in the top-right corner of the JFrame, nothing happens. In other words, the X-button is totally disabled.
- When the user clicks the button with the caption Quit, the program terminates and returns control to the operating system.
- When a mouse press occurs within the JFrame object, the program displays the mouse coordinates near the point of the mouse press with the horizontal coordinate (X) being displayed first, the vertical coordinate (Y) being displayed second, and the two separated by a comma and a space, as in 150, 80
- Only one pair of coordinate values may appear at any time.
- The 0,0 coordinate is immediately below the left end of the Quit button.
