#asg06

**Description:** For this project, I wrote the code in **[Proj06Runner.java](Proj06Runner.java)** to produce a GUI constructed of Swing components that met the requirements posted below.

**Requirements:**
- Your program must display a Frame object. Your name must appear in the banner at the top of the frame.
- When you move your mouse pointer around inside the client area of the frame, without pressing either mouse button, the coordinates of the mouse pointer appear directly above the pointer. In this case, the coordinates are displayed using black characters.
- When you move your mouse pointer around inside the client area of the frame, while pressing either mouse button, the coordinates of the mouse pointer appear directly above the pointer. In this case, the coordinates are displayed using red characters.
- In both cases, the horizontal coordinate (X) is displayed first and the vertical coordinate (Y) is displayed second, and the two are separated by a comma and a space, (as in 182, 50).
- The origin (0,0) is at the upper-left corner of the frame underneath the blue banner. Therefore, vertical coordinate values less than about 32 cannot be disaplayed.
- When you click on the close button in the upper right corner of the frame, the program terminates and control must be properly returned to the operating system.
